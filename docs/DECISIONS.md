# MindTrainer â€“ Decisions Log

## Vision
MindTrainer is a local-first mental wellness app that provides gentle, trauma-safe emotional support through animal-themed check-ins and focus sessions. The app prioritizes user safety and privacy by keeping all data on-device and avoiding medical claims or clinical language.

## Must-Haves
- **Animal-based emotional check-ins** - Positive, non-clinical way for users to track how they're feeling
- **Focus timer sessions** - Core mindfulness/concentration feature with persistence across app restarts
- **Trauma-safe language throughout** - All UI text must avoid clinical terms, blame language, and achievement pressure
- **Offline-first functionality** - App must work completely without internet connection
- **Local data storage only** - No user data leaves the device without explicit consent
- **Emergency support resources** - Crisis support information with clear disclaimers about professional care
- **Child-safe design** - Interface and language appropriate for younger users

## Guardrails

### Ethics and Safety Constraints
- **No medical claims** - App cannot suggest it provides medical treatment, diagnosis, or therapy
- **Trauma-informed language** - Avoid clinical, blame-focused, or achievement-pressure terms
- **Professional care disclaimers** - Emergency features must direct users to qualified professionals
- **Crisis support** - Always include pathways to real human support, never replace it
- **Age-appropriate content** - Design must be safe for children while serving adults

### Privacy and Security Constraints
