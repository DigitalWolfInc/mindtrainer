## Mood Score Mapping
For cross-feature insights (mood ‚Üî focus correlation), animal moods are mapped to numeric scores on a 1-10 scale where higher scores indicate moods associated with higher energy/focus potential:

- **Energetic Rabbit** (üê∞): 9.0 - High energy, ready for action
- **Curious Cat** (üê±): 8.0 - Active interest and engagement  
- **Playful Dolphin** (üê¨): 7.0 - Fun-seeking, moderately active
- **Wise Owl** (ü¶â): 6.0 - Thoughtful, contemplative
- **Gentle Deer** (ü¶å): 4.0 - Quiet, gentle energy
- **Calm Turtle** (üê¢): 3.0 - Low energy, peaceful pace

This mapping is used in `lib/features/insights/domain/mood_focus_insights.dart` for computing Pearson correlation between daily mood scores and focus session minutes.
