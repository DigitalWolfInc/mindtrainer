## CTA Design Rules

### Primary CTA Guidelines

- **Clear value**: Specific benefit, not generic "Upgrade"
- **Action-oriented**: Start with verbs (Unlock, Discover, Access)

### Secondary CTA Guidelines  
- **Non-dismissive**: Avoid negative framing like "No Thanks"
- **Neutral options**: "Maybe Later", "Continue Free", "Not Now"
- **Path preservation**: User can return to Pro offer easily
- **No shame**: Never imply user is missing out by choosing free

## Dynamic Copy Selection Logic

### User Context Triggers

- **Explorer User** (tries many features): Curiosity style, emphasize discovery

- **Data User** (checks analytics often): Curiosity style, promise deeper insights

### Session Context Triggers

- **After Goal Completion**: Achievement style
- **During Feature Discovery**: Curiosity style

## A/B Testing Framework Integration

### Test Categories
1. **Headline Variants**: 3 emotional approaches per surface
2. **CTA Text**: Action words vs. benefit words vs. curiosity hooks
3. **Feature Presentation**: Bullet points vs. paragraphs vs. benefit statements
4. **Visual Style**: Icons, colors, and emphasis techniques

### Success Metrics

- **Conversion Rate**: From surface view to completed purchase
- **Time to Convert**: Days from first Pro surface view to purchase
- **Surface Attribution**: Which surface drove the conversion

## Compliance & Policy Alignment

### Google Play Requirements
- ‚úÖ **Essential features free**: All core functionality available without Pro
- ‚úÖ **Clear value proposition**: Pro features enhance but don't replace free
- ‚úÖ **Transparent pricing**: Always show price and billing terms
- ‚úÖ **Easy cancellation**: Cancel anytime messaging prominent

### Psychological Ethics
- ‚úÖ **No manipulation**: Honest representation of Pro benefits  
- ‚úÖ **No FOMO tactics**: Avoid fake scarcity or time pressure
- ‚úÖ **Respect choice**: Dignified free tier without constant interruption
- ‚úÖ **Value-first**: Lead with user benefit, not company profit

## Copy Quality Standards

### Tone Guidelines
- **Scientific but accessible**: Reference data and insights without jargon
- **Encouraging never pushy**: Supportive growth language
- **Personal but not intimate**: Recognize user effort without being overly familiar
- **Benefit-focused**: What user gains, not what they're missing

### Language Requirements
- **No medical claims**: "Focus" and "wellness" not "treatment" or "therapy"
- **No guarantees**: "Can help" not "will improve"  
- **Inclusive language**: Avoid assumptions about user circumstances
- **Plain English**: 8th grade reading level maximum

## Implementation Notes

### Dynamic Copy System
```dart
class ProSurfaceCopy {
  static String getHeadline(ProSurface surface, CopyStyle style, UserContext context) {
    // Implementation uses user behavioral data to select appropriate copy variant
    // Integrates with A/B testing framework for systematic optimization
  }
}
```

### Analytics Integration
- Track which copy variants drive highest engagement
- Monitor user sentiment through session quality after Pro exposure
- Measure long-term retention impact of different messaging approaches
- Optimize based on conversion attribution and user satisfaction metrics

---

**Key Principle**: Every Pro surface should feel like a natural extension of the user's focus journey, offering genuine value that enhances their existing practice rather than interrupting it.
