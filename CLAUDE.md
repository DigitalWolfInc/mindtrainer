# MindTrainer Flutter App

## Project Overview
Flutter application for mental training and cognitive exercises.

## Context Sources
Before proposing features, wording, or architecture, consult docs/memory_core_v1/ and its contents. All development must align with System_Ethics_&_Safety.md, Pricing_Strategy.md, and any UX flow documents within this folder.

## Development Commands
- `flutter run` - Run the app in debug mode
- `flutter build` - Build the app for production
- `flutter test` - Run unit and widget tests
- `flutter doctor` - Check Flutter installation and dependencies
- If a requested change touches ethics/safety, confirm with System_Ethics_&_Safety.md before editing UI copy.
- Prefer local-first features; if cloud or subscriptions are required, ask once before adding any remote dependency.
